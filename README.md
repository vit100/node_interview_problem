# Introduction 
Application to calculate total population based on data describing each country population.

Current implementation only provides unit test. 
 - Finish uncompleted unit test;
 - Provide implementation to pass unit tests;
 - Create web API (your choice of framework, express/nestjs, etc) to expose function as web service; Api should accept data collection as input and return result of calculation;
 - Implement logging logic to log each request details into log file;
 - Prepare application for publishing - npm publish;
 - Suggest ways to secure API;
 - Contenerize application - use docker; run application in docker. Make sure application log file persistent.
